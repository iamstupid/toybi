# toybi
Just a toy project of big int, even without division(now).

Contains a non-trivial allocator(though very memory-consuming),and a karatsuba implementation. Correctness hasn't been tested; but a squaring is performed in the `test.cpp` with correct output anyway, though the testcase is very weak (due to convenience).
